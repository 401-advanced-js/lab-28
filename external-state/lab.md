* Add a constructor and declare a state object
* "state" should have "count" and "name" properties
* Create a "handler" method that will take name as a parameter and updates the state with the given name and an increased count
* Import a new "Form" component (created in the steps below later)
* Render the "Form" component with a reference to the update method created above, via property
* Create a new "Form" Component
* Add a form element with a single field
* As the user types in the field, change the "name" property in state
* When the user "submits" the form invoke handler method in the parent component, sending the updated name
* The output section below should update as state changes

**Challenge Instructions (Part 2)**

* Fork your completed sandbox
* Refactor your work using new modules for each component
* Be prepared to discuss/defend file & directory structures chosen
